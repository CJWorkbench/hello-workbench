# hello-workbench

Example Workbench module for new developers.  To get started:

* Clone this repo
* Clone the main workbench repo into a sibling directory and set up a Workbench [development environment](https://github.com/CJWorkbench/cjworkbench/wiki/Setting-up-a-development-environment)
* Fire up Workbench with `bin/dev start`
* Watch the module directory with `bin/dev develop-module hello-workbench`. This will re-import the module whenever you make any changes.
* Browse to `https://localhost:8000` to use Workbench and try out your module
* Make an edit in the `json` or `py` file, then refresh the page to see it (for certain changes you may also need to remove and re-add the module in the workflow)

For lots more information, see the [module development documentation](https://github.com/CJWorkbench/cjworkbench/wiki/Creating-A-Module).
